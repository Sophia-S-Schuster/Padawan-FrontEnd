                    Hello! I'm a Full Stack Developer from Brazil. 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Sophia, I am in my twenties doing my graduation (wich is called computer science  in Brazil) at UFSCar. I was born in "São Paulo" (as far I'm concerned) and bred in Ribeirão Preto. <br><br>
                    I am now starting my first job at Monitora.
                    Althought I am holding myself back a little during this first days I am so happy to be there! Doing what I love in a place that I love is the best thing that I could dream to achieve in this "quarentine". I hope to work my way up 
                    to some good post and to be a proud for my family and for myself! <br><br>
                    I love the logic of coding. I also love challenges and in my spare time you will find me playing some games :)
